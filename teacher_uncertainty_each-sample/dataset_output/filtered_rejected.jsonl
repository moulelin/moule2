{"question": "### Real-World Application Problem\n\n**Context:** A civil engineer is designing a bridge and needs to calculate the total load capacity and the effective stress distribution across different sections of the bridge. The calculations involve both arithmetic operations and algebraic simplifications.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\n1. **Load Capacity Calculation:**\n   - The bridge has a main support beam that can withstand a maximum load of \\( -202 \\) tons when no additional supports are used. However, the engineer plans to use a special material that increases the load capacity by a factor of \\( 3^0 \\). Additionally, the bridge will have two auxiliary supports, each contributing \\( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-2} \\) times the absolute difference between the initial and final load capacities. Finally, the engineer needs to consider the square root of the total area covered by the supports, which is 12 square meters.\n   - Calculate the total load capacity of the bridge using the formula:\n     \\[\n     -202 \\cdot 3^{0} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-2} \\times | -1 + 3 | + \\sqrt{12}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Stress Distribution Calculation:**\n   - The engineer is also tasked with simplifying the expression for the stress distribution across different sections of the bridge.

The effective length of the beam, crucial for determining its structural integrity, can be calculated using the formula $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{81} + \\sqrt{81} + \\sqrt{45}}{3}}$. Additionally, the engineer must ensure that the effective length does not exceed 4 meters to meet safety standards.\n\nThe bridge also includes a triangular section where the support beam forms one side of the triangle. The other two sides of the triangle are 5 meters and 6 meters long. Using the effective length of the support beam as one side, determine if the triangle formed is a right triangle. Calculate the effective length of the support beam and verify if it meets the safety requirement and if the triangle is a right triangle.", "source": "omni_math", "difficulty": "hard", "strategy": "compose", "round": 3, "se": 0.6664, "se_weight": 0.3336, "se_raw": 1.3857, "n_valid_responses": 8, "reject_reason": "REJECT: Problem combines multiple questions and requires more than a closed-form answer."}
